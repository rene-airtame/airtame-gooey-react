# Airtame Gooey React CHANGELOG


## v0.4.6

[Diff](https://github.com/airtame/airtame-gooey-react/compare/v0.4.5...v0.4.6)

- Fix SideDrawer onOverlay click
```
Behaviour is unexpected especially when selecting text in input fields (or any text) and by accident dragging the selection outside of the side drawer area (attached a screencast to the issue)

This is critical because closing a modal (side drawer) will loose all the information added by the user and user will have to re-enter it.
